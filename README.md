# topographic-processing
This repo contains a set of R Functions and example workflow scripts for processing DEMs to create input for hydrologic models

### DEM processing

### Slope calculations

### Workflow scripts
Four workflow scripts are provided to demonstrate processing for four examples of increasing complexity
1. **Workflow_Example1.R**: Rectangular domain with no river network
2. **Workflow_Example2.R**: Irregular domain with no river network
3. **Workflow_Example3.R**: Rectangular domain with river network
4. **Workflow_Example4.R**: Irregular domain with river network
